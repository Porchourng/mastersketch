% You have to really dig. Be introspective. Don't settle for I love this field. Why do you love this field? Why do you want to work in this field for the rest of your life? Why does it complete you?

% \subsection{General Notes}
% \label{sec:General}
%   \begin{enumerate}
% 	\item  If, for instance, you talk about your deep desire to make society a better place, your application should reflect it. Have you done anything about this desire? Can you talk about your actions and experiences

% \item How to make the essay unique 
%  One of the best ways to do this is to discuss, briefly, an idea in your field that turns you on intellectually. It's an effective essay-opener, and it lets you write about something besides yourself for a bit. There are other benefits as well. The idea you choose to talk about, and your comments on it, often tell an admissions committee more about you than your own self-descriptions can.
% Discussing an idea will catch people's attention and give your readers a reprieve from people writing about themselves. That me-me-me  stuff can get irritating after a while, even though it's what the prompt asks for. A discussion of an idea demonstrates your interest in your field, rather than just describing it. Ultimately, that's more convincing.

% The boundless possibility of trying out and the instant knowledge of the outcome that stimulates one for further analysis of a rationale in question, is what I find most appealing about Computer Science. Keeping up an inquisitive and explorative attitude, I believe, leads to a constant learning process. This approach adds to the already immense potential for innovation that exists in this field.
% As a student in the final year of undergraduate study for a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science \& Engineering, I look to graduate study to refine my knowledge and skills in my areas of interest. I believe it will also serve to give direction to my goal of a career as a research professional at an academic or commercial, research-oriented organisation. I intend to pursue an MS degree in order to reach that goal.
%  \subsection{ Academic Background \& Research Interests}
%  In my undergraduate studies, I have benefited from the breadth of Shivaji Universitys syllabi content that has given me a comprehensive exposure to the core areas of Computer Science and a strong conceptual understanding of the same. In these three and half years of study, I have strived to maintain an approach of expending independent effort in all my endeavors. Learning by myself and sharing my knowledge with others has been most worthwhile, when comprehending a concept.
%  Over the past two years, I have developed an interest in the areas of Compiler Construction and Information Retrieval. The Compiler Construction lab sessions last semester required the design of a compiler for C++ programs that were restricted to For loops, Switch case statements and simple input and output. The work involved in this, as well as the courses, Formal Systems and Automata and Compiler Construction, have lead me to appreciate the intricacies involved in this field. However, for my MS degree, I remain open to other topics as well.
%   For my B.E project, I have decided to concentrate on my other area of interest viz. Information Retrieval. Im attempting to evolve a technique that, when employed in a search engine, will maximize the comprehensiveness and precision of the query listings. The ongoing work has introduced me to a vast body of pertinent research, such as the University of Washingtons Dynamic Reference Sifting technique for locating an individuals homepage, among others. This has served to sharpen my inclination to engage in active research within this area.
% 	  \subsection{ (Please see attached Resume  for the Academic and Co-curricular distinctions)}
% One persons life influences the lives of an unbelievable number of people, one of the most important lessons I learned, being the Head of the Apex Body at senior secondary level (11th and 12th standard). Hence the need of responsible actions. Becoming the youngest Head of the Apex Body ever and the only one to have served for a period of two years eventually turned out to be a confidence booster. It taught me that the basis for good work is self-reliance and very importantly, time management. Not all of my entire two years were devoid of shortcomings. I learned to accept both criticism and praise with a positive frame of mind. My work involved organising various events, that brought with them the opportunity to work and interact with various kinds of people. This was a distinctively gratifying experience for me, which I feel would stand in good stead in the future, especially in lieu of any teaching experience.
%   In conclusion, I would like to add that the essence of University education lies in the synergetic relationship between the student and his department. I feel that graduate study at your University will be the most logical extension of my academic pursuits and a major step towards achieving my objectives. I would be grateful to you if Im accorded the opportunity to pursue my graduate studies with financial assistance at your institution and am able to justify your faith in me.

% Artificial Intelligence and Image processing was two of the most interesting courses that I took in my last year in undergraduate school. 
% I always thought of a computer as a super intelligent machine, understanding that simple trivial tasks for humans are considered the most challenging problems in computer science was inspiring. The knowledge was gained when I took Artificial Intelligence and Image processing in my last year in undergraduate school. Taking these courses affected my choice for graduation project, it made me think more of a research project that tends to AI and Machine Vision rather than other disciplines. My graduation project (Face Recognition) was chosen to help me pursuit more understanding on the problems of Machine Vision. 
% //further increase my  in  improve my knowledge and  to I choose my graduation project  to solve one of the Machine vision problems. 
% Teaching and work in resala with the orphans helped me to tone my temper and given to improve my weakness as I wanted to present an ideal for the children that they can imetate. It helped me focus on how could I improve my self more to help myself and my comunity. 
%  My research intereset are in field of software engineering in how to use old experiences, projects, bugs, programs to help improve the quality and speed of the software engineering process. using AI, data mining methods is one of the major ideas that are used to help use old requriments in the new software project.  It may not be a silver bullet that solve the software engineering problems but adding new thinking that may help practiceners. 
%  My interset in helping user interact with the computer as humans, we should be able to sketch , write , speak to a computer and be understood. These are trivial things for humans but they are major chalanges in AI. Until now cursive handwriting like arabic and other langauge are still a chanllanging problem. Recognizing sketch is also another field that only recently had atracted researcher. The dificulty is mainly the amount of ambuigus of how different humans write using different style. 
%  I love about reading is gaining more knowldge , I starve for more knowldge more understanding knowing that the more i read the more i new of new areas that i want to know about and i add the my reading list. I remmeber the first book i read about software engineering, \"twenty years : no silver bullet\" it was amazing book and it made me think more of software engneering it made me read more of the topic and get interseted in the current research and new techolgies that solve these problems.   It is entertainig to live with a book and know mroe about other, how they think and how they feel and what motivate others I feel like i am gainig their experience plus my own.

I gained more experience in managing other and helping them adopt to new knowledge and how to a here to concepts that will provide effective productive products.

%\section{Essay Machine Learning}
 
%introduction and motivationss 
 Computers can be easily programed to do things that are difficult to humans, this statement was my assumption for a long time. In my senior year as an undergraduate in computer engineering major I found out that trivial functions for human are the most challenging problems in computer science. This new acquired knowledge put me to think about my previous assumption and gave me new ideas on what are the main problems in computer science. Advanced courses in Artificial Intelligence and computer vision taught me that speaking, listening, seeing and understanding information is the most challenging problems in computer science. Interpreting cursive handwriting, understanding spoken instructions or even learning a new skill are simple operations for human but are difficult problems in machines. Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence are one of the most active fields in computer science research.
 
  My Interest in Artificial intelligence and Image processing encouraged me look for a research problem that combines AI and Image processing as a graduation project. I choose the research to be in (Face recognition and Identification) because the problem is challenging and by helping in solving it will improve in solving a lot of problems. During the project, I was responsible for collecting the data and analyzing the performances of similar systems to finally reach design and help in implementation of a new system. This research showed me what it meant to work in research on one hand the frustration of wrong or unexplained result.On the other hand, the thrill and the continuous motivation to gain more information, ideas and investigate more creative problem solving and thinking techniques. In short, I knew then that I want to continue to work in the scientific research.
  
	Even thought my dream is to become a scientific researcher I believed that I need more practical experience before more involvement in another academic research. Thus, I  worked for four years as a Software Engineer in a small company called EngNet. During my work I gathered some valuable research skills as I was engaged in various discussions and negotiations with clients and my own team members. The experience taught me how to resolve differences between different opinions and compromise to reach a final decisions that will be acceptable by others. I was quickly promoted to Team Leader for a software team of five engineers and as a project leader I had to plan, coordinate, and  supervise my team to achieve the company goals. I continually needed to evaluated my team organizations and operation to guide the team to better engineering practices that will help enhance and maximize the team and company performance. Learning new skills on how to supervise and evaluate operations of software projects lead me to research on how to implement software practices that will improve the company performance and products.
	
 These research activities along with my research oriented graduation project emphasized to me that my dream is to work as researcher in an academic or private institute. Therefore, I was motivated to focus more research so and when I had an opportunity to join a research lab,I was eager to accepted it. Since 2007, I am a part of 'Signal and Image Processing' research group in Electronic Research Institute (ERI). The position offered a group research enviorment which I believe from my experience is essential for conducting any a constructive research. Engaging in research discussions and meeting opened my mind  on other field of research other that my own this information is by whole helpful in providing me with a breath of information that will sure guide me in my long term goal. My work in ERI focused on investigating and evaluating the use of Swarm Intelligence in field of Image processing. I also worked on integrating this work with my thesis in Sketch Recognition and Understanding. We worked on evaluating the efficiency of different Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms on segmenting users hand drawn sketch.     
 	
	I believe that any academic or scientific researcher must acquire at least some tutoring skill and experience. Thus, prior to my work in EngNet company, I worked as Teaching Assistant in October University for Modern Science and Art (MSA). Also, I am currently working as a Teaching and Research assistant in American University in Cairo (AUC), since Sep. 2008. My responsibility include preparing tutorials and course materials, correcting assignment and projects. I am also obliged \textit{(responsible)} to assist in presenting and advising in various courses ranging from Software Engineering and AI to Logic Design and Embedded Systems. Even though my main goal is to become a researcher, teaching is itself an enriching experience and improved my skills in both my professional and personal aspects. My research in AUC focus on Arabic Digit Recognition specifically analysing and measuring the efficiency of  different features and classification algorithms. % research interset
	 
	Machine learning is my main field of research interest, mainly the use of machine learning algorithms in image processing in general and specifically cursive handwriting processing. Even though the problem of handwriting processing has been nearly resolved for some language, other languages like Arabic and Chinese still faces many difficulties. Problems in handwriting processing in an nonrestrictive enviorment are due to the huge amount of fonts, styles and shapes that these languages posses. Another area of research that tempts me is the use artificial intelligence in software engineering. Ideas like  generating code based on previous similar requirements or using natural language to represents reusable requirements that can be automatically transformed into running programs. My interest in these area is based on my previous experience as a software engineer where I continually researched for ideas and procedures to improve and speed the development process.% program and school..
	
 	In conclusion, to continue to achieve my goals in being a researcher in an academic institute I must move forward to acquire a PhD Degree. My choice of studying abroad is based not only the research experience that I will gain in  studying in another university but also on diversity of experiences I am sure I will gain by travelling to Canada. Calgary University ranked as one of the top universities in Canada provides me with the high calibre qualities that I need to earn my vision. I know that graduate studies at your university in the logical next step in my pursuit to achieve my goals. I am sure that my qualities highlighted along with my research interest can provide an excellent reason for your institution to accord me admission as  a PhD graduate student.
