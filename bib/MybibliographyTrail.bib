With our interface, users can construct functional engineering models simply by drawing sketches on a computer screen. Unlike paper sketches, however, our interface allows users to interact with their sketches in real time to modify existing objects and add new ones. To demonstrate the utility of our system, we have developed a sketch-based interface for designing and analyzing simple vibratory mechanical systems. The technical contributions of our work include: (1) a sketch parsing method for automatically locating the distinct graphical symbols in a sketch, (2) a general-purpose, trainable symbol recognizer, and (3) special purpose prerecognizers that consider shape information and make use of drawing conventions.},

	abstract = {The goal of this work is to create a robot interface that allows a novice user to guide, control, and/or program a robot to perform some task. The assumption is that, although the user may be a domain expert in how the task should be done, he is not an expert in robotics. During the actual robot use, he should focus on the task to be done rather than worrying about the robot or the interaction modality. To address this goal, we have been investigating the use of hand-drawn route maps to transfer navigation tasks to robots. In the paper, we provide an overview and current status of ongoing work with sketches. We discuss what type of information would be useful for directing and controlling a robot and then show how this information can be extracted from a sketched route map, in the form of spatial relationships. An analysis example of a PDA-generated sketch is included. Also, preliminary results are presented which compare the analysis of a sketched map with that of a real map.},

This paper reviews a series of experiments which indicate that interactional context also plays a key role in the interpretation of drawings and sketches. Two experimental graphical communication tasks, analogous to definite reference tasks, are described. The findings from these tasks show significant parallels between the mechanisms of co-ordination in graphical dialogue and natural language dialogue. Specifically: participants match on drawing types above chance, `graphical referring expressions' reduce with repetition in an interaction, direct interaction promotes the use of more abstract drawings, and communityspecific graphical conventions emerge in experimental `subcommunities '.},

Most designers use pencil and paper at first, and only input their design into CAD systems after it is nearly complete. The tradeoff between the ease of drawing and the precision of a CAD tool is too great in for engineers who are just sketching out rough designs. My thesis will present a tool which is specifically geared towards designers in the earlier stages of design. Our system interprets and represents mechanical sketches as the user sketches them, then allows the user to simulate her system using a two-dimensional kinematic simulator. In particular, my thesis will introduce a method to translate a sketch into the designer's intended mechanical devices, despite ambiguities in the sketch.},

The program takes freehand sketches of physical devices as input. It begins by recognizing the symbols used in the sketch.

The physical reasoning relies on qualitative behavior models, simple qualitative models describing energy flow through physical components. Through the physical reasoning, the program is able to disambiguate the meanings of the individual symbols and produce a natural language (text) description of how the sketched device would operate.},

It collects observations from our own recent research, which focused initially on the domain of sketched human stick figures in diverse postures, as well as related computer vision literature. Sketch recognition, i.e., labeling strokes in the input with the names of the model parts they depict, would be a key component of higher-level sketch understanding processes that reason about the recognized configurations. A sketch recognition technology must meet three main requirements. It must cope reliably with the pervasive variability of hand sketches, provide interactive performance, and be easily extensible to new configurations. We argue that useful sketch recognition may be within the grasp of current research, if these requirements are addressed systematically and in concert.},

We selected a set of algorithms to perform image vectorization, taking into account the trade-off between vector image quality and processing time. This method of specifying queries is part of a system to retrieve vector drawings, which we briefly describe in this paper.
