 abstract             = {Despite the growing number of sketch recognition sys- tems for education, little attention has been paid to how stu- dents actually draw in practice. We examine freely-drawn digital logic diagrams created by students in an electrical engineering class in order to inform the design of a sketch recognition digital circuit simulation tool. Our analysis reveals considerable drawing style variation between stu- dents and that standard drawing style restrictions made by sketch recognition systems to aid recognition generally do not match the way students draw. We identify drawing be- haviors that can aid recognition while placing fewer un- natural constraints on students' drawing styles, and we de- scribe specific recognition tasks whose solutions will lead to more robust free-sketch recognition systems.},

 abstract             = {The goal of this work is to create a robot interface that allows a novice user to guide, control, and/or program a robot to perform some task. The asmmption is that, although the user may be a domain expert in how the task should be done, he is not an expert in robotics. During the actual robot use, he should focus on the task to be done rather than worrying about the robot or the interaction modality. To address this goal, we have been investigating the use of hand-drawn route maps to transfer navigation tasks to robots. In the paper, we provide an overview and current status of ongoing work with sketches. We discuss what type of information would be useful for directing and controlling a robot and then show how this information can be extracted from a sketched route map, in the form of spatial relationships. An analysis example of a PDA-generated sketch is included. Also, preliminary results are presented which compare the analysis of a sketched map with that of a real map.},

This paper reviews a series of experiments which indicate that interactional context also plays a key role in the interpretation of drawings and sketches. Two experimental graphical communication tasks, analogous to definite reference tasks, are described. The findings from these tasks show significant parallels between the mechanisms of co-ordination in graphical dialogue and natural language dialogue. Specifically: participants match on drawing types above chance, `graphical referring expressions' reduce with repetition in an interaction, direct interaction promotes the use of more abstract drawings, and communityspecific graphical conventions emerge in experimental `subcommunities '.},

 abstract             = {Current computer-based design tools for mechanical engineers are not tailored to early stages of design. Most designers use pencil and paper at first, and only input their design into CAD systems after it is nearly complete. The tradeoff between the ease of drawing and the precision of a CAD tool is too great in for engineers who are just sketching out rough designs. My thesis will present a tool which is specifically geared towards designers in the earlier stages of design. Our system interprets and represents mechanical sketches as the user sketches them, then allows the user to simulate her system using a two-dimensional kinematic simulator. In particular, my thesis will introduce a method to translate a sketch into the designer's intended mechanical devices, despite ambiguities in the sketch.},

 abstract             = {Pen-based user interfaces are becoming ever more popular. Gestures (i.e., marks made with a pen to invoke a command) are a valuable aspect of pen-based UIs, but they also have drawbacks. The challenge in designing good gestures is to make them easy for people to learn and remember. With the goal of better gesture design, we performed a pair of experiments to determine why users find gestures similar. From these experiments, we have derived a computational model for predicting perceived gesture similarity that correlates 0.56 with observation. We will incorporate the results of these experiments into a gesture design tool, which will aid the pen-based UI designer in creating gesture sets that are easier to learn and more memorable.},

 abstract             = {Hand drawn sketches are an important part of the early design process and are an important aspect of creative design. They are used in many fields including electrical engineering, software engineering and web design. Recognizing shapes in these sketches is a challenging task due to the imprecision with which they are drawn. We tackle this challenge with a visual approach to recognition. The approach is based on a representation of a sketched shape in terms of the visual parts it is made of. By taking this part-based visual approach we are able to recognize shapes that are extremely difficult to recognize with current sketch recognition systems that focus on the individual strokes.

Heretofore, most interaction between man and computers has been slowed down by the need to reduce all communication to written statements that can be typed; in the past, we have been writing letters to rather than conferring with our computers. For many types of communication, such as describing the shape of a mechanical part or the connections of an electrical circuit, typed statements can prove cumbersome. The Sketchpad system, by eliminating typed statements (except for legends) in favor of line drawings, opens up a new area of man-machine communication.},

@book{swarmGeneral,
 abstract             = {Social insects--ants, bees, termites, and wasps--can be viewed as powerful problem-solving systems with sophisticated collective intelligence. Composed of simple interacting agents, this intelligence lies in the networks of interactions among individuals and between individuals and the environment. A fascinating subject, social insects are also a powerful metaphor for artificial intelligence, and the problems they solve--finding food, dividing labor among nestmates, building nests, responding to external challenges--have important counterparts in engineering and computer science. This book provides a detailed look at models of social insect behavior and how to apply these models in the design of complex systems. The book shows how these models replace an emphasis on control, preprogramming, and centralization with designs featuring autonomy, emergence, and distributed functioning. These designs are proving immensely flexible and robust, able to adapt quickly to changing environments and to continue functioning even when individual elements fail. In particular, these designs are an exciting approach to the tremendous growth of complexity in software and information. Swarm Intelligence draws on up-to-date research from biology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, robotics, operations research, and computer graphics, and each chapter is organized around a particular biological example, which is then used to develop an algorithm, a multiagent system, or a group of robots. The book will be an invaluable resource for a broad range of disciplines.},

 abstract             = {curvilinear configurations to hand-drawn sketches. It collects observations from our own recent research, which focused initially on the domain of sketched human stick figures in diverse postures, as well as related computer vision literature. Sketch recognition, i.e., labeling strokes in the input with the names of the model parts they depict, would be a key component of higher-level sketch understanding processes that reason about the recognized configurations. A sketch recognition technology must meet three main requirements. It must cope reliably with the pervasive variability of hand sketches, provide interactive performance, and be easily extensible to new configurations. We argue that useful sketch recognition may be within the grasp of current research, if these requirements are addressed systematically and in concert.},

 abstract             = {Current approaches to content-based retrieval of multimedia data usually rely either on query by example or on sketches of the desired image, but not on both. In this paper, we propose a new query specification scheme, where digital images are combined with sketches, after vectorization, taking advantage of both methods. We selected a set of algorithms to perform image vectorization, taking into account the trade-off between vector image quality and processing time. This method of specifying queries is part of a system to retrieve vector drawings, which we briefly describe in this paper.

With our interface, users can construct functional engineering models simply by drawing sketches on a computer screen. Unlike paper sketches, however, our interface allows users to interact with their sketches in real time to modify existing objects and add new ones. To demonstrate the utility of our system, we have developed a sketch-based interface for designing and analyzing simple vibratory mechanical systems. The technical contributions of our work include: (1) a sketch parsing method for automatically locating the distinct graphical symbols in a sketch, (2) a general-purpose, trainable symbol recognizer, and (3) special purpose prerecognizers that consider shape information and make use of drawing conventions.},
