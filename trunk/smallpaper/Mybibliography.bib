  abstract = {We describe a program that uses both geometric and
		 physical reasoning to interpret schematic sketches of
		 physical devices. The program takes freehand sketches
		 of physical devices as input. It begins by recognizing
		 the symbols used in the sketch. It then uses geometric
		 and physics-based reasoning techniques to identify the
		 meaning of each symbol within the context of the
		 sketch. The physical reasoning relies on qualitative
		 behavior models, simple qualitative models describing
		 energy flow through physical components. Through the
		 physical reasoning, the program is able to disambiguate
		 the meanings of the individual symbols and produce a
		 natural language (text) description of how the sketched
		 device would operate.},

		 labeling strokes in the input with the names of the
		 model parts they depict, would be a key component of
		 higher-level sketch understanding processes that reason
		 about the recognized configurations. A sketch
		 recognition technology must meet three main
		 requirements. It must cope reliably with the pervasive
		 variability of hand sketches, provide interactive
		 performance, and be easily extensible to new
		 configurations. We argue that useful sketch recognition
		 may be within the grasp of current research, if these
		 requirements are addressed systematically and in
		 concert.},

		 robotics. During the actual robot use, he should focus
		 on the task to be done rather than worrying about the
		 robot or the interaction modality. To address this
		 goal, we have been investigating the use of hand-drawn
		 route maps to transfer navigation tasks to robots. In
		 the paper, we provide an overview and current status of
		 ongoing work with sketches. We discuss what type of
		 information would be useful for directing and
		 controlling a robot and then show how this information
		 can be extracted from a sketched route map, in the form
		 of spatial relationships. An analysis example of a
		 PDA-generated sketch is included. Also, preliminary
		 results are presented which compare the analysis of a
