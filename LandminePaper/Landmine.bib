abstract = {A novel data acquisition and imaging method is pre- sented for stepped-frequency continuous-wave ground penetrating radars (SFCW GPRs). It is shown that if the target space is sparse, i.e., a small number of point like targets, it is enough to make mea- surements at only a small number of random frequencies to con- struct an image of the target space by solving a convex optimization problem which enforces sparsity through t minimization. This measurement strategy greatly reduces the data acquisition time at the expense of higher computational costs. Imaging results for both simulated and experimental GPR data exhibit less clutter than the standard migration methods and are robust to noise and random spatial sampling. The images also have increased resolution where closely spaced targets that cannot be resolved by the standard mi- gration methods can be resolved by the proposed method},

@article{Counts2007,
abstract = {A multistatic ground-penetrating radar (GPR) sys- tem has been developed and used to measure the response of a number of targets to produce data for the investigation of multi- static inversion algorithms. The system consists of a linear array of resistive-vee antennas, microwave switches, a vector network analyzer, and a 3-D positioner, all under computer control. The array has two transmitters and four receivers which provide eight bistatic spacings from 12 to 96 cm in 12-cm increments. Buried targets are scanned with and without surface clutter, which is a layer of rocks whose spacing is empirically chosen to maximize the clutter effect. The measured responses are calibrated so that the direct coupling in the system is removed, and the signal reference point is located at the antenna drive point. Images are formed us- ing a frequency-domain beamforming algorithm that compensates for the phase response of the antennas. Images of targets in air validate the system calibration and the imaging algorithm. Bistatic and multistatic images for the buried targets are very good, and they show the effectiveness of the system and processing.},

abstract = {The Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) based Acoustic to Seismic (A/S) landmine detection system is one of the reliable and powerfullandmine detection systems. The interpretation of the LDV based A/S data is performed off-line, manually, depending heavily on the skills, experience, alertness and consistency of a trained operator. This takes a long time. The manually obtained results suffer from errors, particularly when dealing with large volumes of data. This paper proposes some techniques for the automatic detection of objects from the acoustic images which are obtained from the LDV-based A/S landmine detection system. These techniques are based on color image transformations, morphological image processing and the wavelet transform. The proposed techniques are compared considering the probability of detection, the false alarm rate, the accuracy and the processing speed.},

abstract = {This paper demonstrates that the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) B an efficient method for the reduction of clutter in Stepped-Frequency Ground Penetrating Radar (SF- GPR) data. In this contribution, two algorithms have been applied for clutter reduction. In the first algorithm, SVD has been applied after mean subtraction and the target has been estimated, The suggestion of applying a threshold and excogitate a new formula to calculate the threshold has been presented on the first algorithm. Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) has been analyzed. In the second algorithm, a background estimate has been done directly using SVD. The technique has been experimentally validated using PMN landmine at different depths.},

@article{Montoya1999,
abstract = {Resistively loaded Vee dipoles are considered for use in a short-pulse ground penetrating radar (GPR) used to detect buried antipersonnel land mines. First, a study is made to select a short pulse to radiate that is most appropriate for the problem. A simple one-dimensional (1-D) analysis of some representative soils and a land mine is used to select a radiated pulse similar in shape to a differentiated Gaussian pulse with a spectral peak at 4 GHz. Based on previous studies, the conductivity of the arms of the Vee dipole is linearly tapered from the feed to the open ends. A fully three-dimensional (3-D) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) model is developed and used to simulate the GPR land mine detection problem. Using this model, a resistively loaded Vee dipole is selected and evaluated. Parametric studies related to the problem are conducted including: varying the height of the Vee above the ground, varying the position of the land mine both laterally and in depth, and examining the effects of the geometry of the land mine on the received signal. Environmental conditions are examined including signal returns from rocks and variations in the shape of the surface of the ground. The FDTD results are validated by comparisons with experimental data. These studies demonstrate that resistively loaded Vee dipoles can greatly reduce clutter related to the antenna, making the task of distinguishing land mines (targets) much easier.},

The kernel function for theSVMis constructed using discrete hid- den Markov modeling (HMM). Typically, the kernel matrix could be obtained by defining an adequate similarity measure in the feature space. However, this approach is inappropriate as it is not trivial to define a meaningful distance metric for sequence comparison. Our proposed approach is based on HMM modeling and has two main steps. First, one HMM is fit to each of the N individual sequences. For each fitted model, we evaluate the log-likelihood of each sequence. This will result in an N x N log-likelihood similarity matrix that will be adapted to serve as the kernel of theSVMclassifier. In the second step, we train an SVM classifier to learn a decision boundary between the positive and negative samples.},
